ClipBar
=======

This is a small utility that can be used to generate barcodes in EAN-8, EAN-13, EAN-128, UPC-A and UPC-E encoding w/ all supported suffexes in WMF vector format.

You can save the produced barcode in vector WMF file or simply copy it to clipboard and paste it in your word-processor of choice including standard Windows Wordpad or MS Office Word.

ClipBar tries to use following fonts for barcode digits (if enabled):
 - [ocrb10](http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/fonts-jp.php)
 - OCR-B 10 BT
 - Arial Narrow
 
Make sure you have one of these fonts installed or digits will default to using Ariel font and overlap.
